# Baby Twins Log

Single-file, offline-friendly daily log for **Twin A & Twin B**. Track feeds, diapers, sleep, notes â€” plus **momâ€™s pump (oz/min)**. Saves to your browser (LocalStorage), exports CSV, and prints cleanly.

**Live site:** https://marthaescudero.github.io/Baby-Twins-Log/

## Features
- Twin A/B entries with time, feed (type/oz/min), **pump (oz/min)**, diaper (W/S/B), sleep (startâ€“end), notes
- **LocalStorage** persistence (data stays on your device)
- **Export CSV**, **Print**, and **Clear Day**
- Mobile-friendly UI (Tailwind via CDN)

## How to use
1. Open the live site (or double-click `index.html` locally).
2. Pick the date â†’ add entries for Twin A/B.
3. Use **Export CSV** to download a daily backup.
4. **Print** for a paper copy if needed.

> Privacy: All data is saved only in your browserâ€™s LocalStorage. Clearing site data or using a different device/browser will not share the data between them.

## Deploy / Update (GitHub Pages)

## Tech
- React 18 (UMD) + Tailwind via CDN
- No build step required; works completely offline as a static file

## Troubleshooting
- **404 on Pages?** Re-check Settings â†’ Pages: `main` + `/ (root)`. Wait ~1 minute and refresh.
- **Changes not showing?** Hard refresh (âŒ˜â‡§R / Ctrl+F5) or clear cache.
- **Data missing on another device?** Expected â€” LocalStorage is per device/browser.
